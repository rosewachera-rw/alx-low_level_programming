The Holberton School coding style is mainly inspired from the [Linux Kernel coding style](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst), but it's slightly modified.
  
See the section `References` of the Linux Kernel coding style for more sources.
