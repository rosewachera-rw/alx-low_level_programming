#Welcome to the Betty wiki!

## Introduction

This document describes the C coding style for [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).  
Coding style is very personal, and **we won't force** our views on anybody.  
But we expect you to **follow this coding style for all the projects related to Holberton School**.
The Holberton School coding style is mainly inspired by the [Linux Kernel coding style](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst), but it's slightly modified.  
To avoid any confusion, please refer to this guide and **not** the official Linux Kernel coding style.

## Reminder

You should be aware that by default, some text editors are using spaces instead of tabs. For instance, when you press `tab` key on emacs, by default, leading spaces will be put, and that will cause Betty to raise a lot of warnings.
Please find some help in the `Tools` section of this documentation.
