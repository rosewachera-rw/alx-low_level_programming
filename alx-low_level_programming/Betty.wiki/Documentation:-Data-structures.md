Besides functions you can also write documentation for `structs`, `unions`, `enums` and `typedefs`.  
Instead of the function name you must write the name of the declaration;  
the `struct`/`union`/`enum`/`typedef` must always precede the name. Nesting of declarations is not supported.  
Use the argument mechanism to document members or constants.

Example:

```C
/**
 * struct my_struct - Short description
 * @a: First member
 * @b: Second member
 * @c: Third member
 *
 * Description: Longer description
 */
struct my_struct
{
	int a;
	int b;
	int c;
};
```

For really longs structs, you can also describe arguments inside the body of the struct.

Example:

```C
/**
 * struct my_struct - Short description
 * @a: First member
 * @b: Second member
 *
 * Description: Longer description
 */
struct my_struct
{
	int a;
	int b;
	/**
	 * @c: This is longer description of C
	 *
	 * Description: You can use paragraphs to describe arguments
	 * using this method.
	 */
	int c;
};
```

This should be use only for `struct`/`enum` members.

Example for a typedef:

```C
/**
 * u_int - Typedef for unsigned int
 */
typedef unsigned int u_int;
```

Of course, you're free to add the `Description` header on any documentation block.
