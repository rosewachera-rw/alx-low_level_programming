### Purpose

> Coding style is all about readability and maintainability using commonly available tools.

___

The limit on the length of lines is **80 columns** and this is a strongly preferred limit.

Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible chunks, unless exceeding 80 columns significantly increases readability and does not hide information.  
Descendants are always substantially shorter than the parent and are placed substantially to the right. The same applies to function headers with a long argument list.
