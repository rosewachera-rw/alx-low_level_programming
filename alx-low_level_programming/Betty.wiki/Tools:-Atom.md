You can check your style and documentation in Atom by using a Linter.

#### Linter

First, you'll need to install the package [linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) that provides the API used by the next package.

To install a package, simply go under Atom to your `Setting`>`Install`, and search for the package you want to install.

#### Betty

Once the linter is installed, you'll need to install the package [linter-betty](https://atom.io/packages/linter-betty) that uses the API from linter to display Betty messages directly on your Atom editor.

Please read the `README` of `linter-betty` for more details about usage and configuration.
